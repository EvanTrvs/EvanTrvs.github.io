        "description": "C++ implementation and optimization of a multidimensional image segmentation algorithm. This programming project developed an image segmentation solution that partitions images into homogeneous regions - a crucial process for complex image analysis (medical imaging MRI, shape detection, 3D reconstruction).\n\nWe particularly focused on improving key criteria:\n- Determinism (for reproducible results)\n- Quality (for precise segmentation)\n- Speed (for efficient processing)\n\nThe project incorporates several technologies: the Boost library for multidimensional array manipulation, multithreading for accelerated computations, optimized memory management, and I/O routines for various image formats (NIfTI, PNG, JPEG, GIF).\n\nThis challenging project allowed me to deepen my skills in low-level C++ programming, object-oriented data structure design, and advanced algorithmics.\n\nProject completed as part of the engineering program at Polytech Tours.",
